        <h1>We Run Rivers To Relax</h1>
        <p>We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for <em>relaxing</em>. That is why we subscribe to the dry oar philosophy of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around and notice the <strong>beauty</strong> that surrounds the rivers we love.</p>

    <h1>We Run Whitewater for the Rush</h1>
    <p class="p2">That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.
